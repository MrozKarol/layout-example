                    <p class="bo-3__paragraph">As much as we love our puppies every dog owner knows the pain of having
                        to get out of a warm and
                        comfy bed on a dark, wet and cold winter morning. Whether our outdoor clothes are safely stored
                        away for taking up too much space, or just due to the usual morning rush, more often than not we
                        are completely underdressed and cold.</p>

                    <p class="bo-3__paragraph">During another long and cold winter in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland in 2019, what
                        initially started out with the "crazy" idea to create the ultimate dog walking suit for dog
                        parents, inspired the quest to create a one of a kind piece of functional cold weather
                        clothing, reimagining how we experience cold weather in our everyday lives.

                    <p class="bo-3__paragraph">With a certain set of requirements and features in mind, we started
                        our research by digging through our closets and browsing the internet. Spending countless
                        hours in front of the computer screen and testing existing outdoor clothes, much to our
                        surprise we were not able to find what we were looking for.

                    <p class="bo-3__paragraph">Our findings showed that most outdoor clothes are designed for
                        specific performance outdoor activities, but not necessarily for everyday usability. Ski
                        suits for example have a heavy protective exterior shell and usually require separate layers
                        of insulation for optimal performance.

                    <p class="bo-3__paragraph">Over time we developed a clear set of requirements and functionalities,
                        so we set out to create such piece of clothing ourselves. While we did know what we wanted
                        Walksey to do, without any actual experience in designing performance outdoor clothes, this
                        process turned out to be more challenging than initially anticipated.

                    <p class="bo-3__paragraph">After several failed attempts at trying to develop a working prototype,
                        luck was ultimately on our side. As it turned out, Poland is world-renowned for its goose down
                        as well as its down products. With some determination we were able to partner with fantastic
                        local outdoor companies with over 30 years of experience in developing ultimate expedition
                        outdoor gear.
